            <p>
                I am a Front End/Python Developer, with a background in website
                development and, before that, in broadcast media. I have approximately
                five years experience in both front and back end development. I started
                as a developer with the arts and literature magazine, Sensitive Skin,
                where I conceptualized and developed the website with the publisher.
                Since then I've been freelancing and have been lucky enough to work for
                clients such as the NYTimes, the Wall Street Journal, Weil, Gotshal and
                Manges, Lazard Asset Management, EPIX TV and, most recently, Mullen Lowe
                Profero.

            <p>
                Lately, I’ve been working with React.js, Vue.js on the front end and
                Python Django framework on the back end, though have used PHP,
                Wordpress, and Laravel extensively in the past. I also create in VR/AR
                using Mozilla’s A-Frame through my work with the language learning
                startup CieloXR. I enjoy working in Python and would like to gain more
                practical experience using it, both in web development and its (many)
                other capacities.

                My work with CieloXR has led to an interest in the possibilities for
                Virtual and Augmented Reality especially in the field of EdTech, along
                with its possibilities in art. I am also starting my own project
                developing living history websites on the Python Django platform. I like
                working in Python and would like to gain more practical experience using
                it, in both web development and its (many) other capacities. I've also
                become interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and
                would, eventually, like to work in those fields, and eventually find a
                way to combing AI/ML with VR for better learning experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also a writer and have published features, stories, and essays, web
                content, occasional copy and have excellent documentation skills. I will
                be writing about VR/AR and AI as I gain more experience and knowledge in
                those fields.
            </p>

            <p>
                This site is built on the Python Django Framework. Eventually I might
                build this out using GraphQL and React (or just in Gatsby.js, which
                combines both), but for the moment it is just plain Django. Please be
                patient while I get this site in order.
