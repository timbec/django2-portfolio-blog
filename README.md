Revised Portfolio with attached Blog built on Django 2 (latest version 2.15). Done mostly as a learning process to familiarize myself with Django and Python3. 

Currently consists of a couple of static pages (perhaps made dynamic at some later point) and a blog. Blog will include ability to comment, send articles by email, contact form, and label articles with tags and categories. 

Will eventually include: 
    - WYSIWYG editor. 
    - ability to share articles via social media
    - customized admin panel. 
    - ability to sort articles via tags and categories. 

For the moment, the styling and interface is very simple as I want to focus on the Django/Python aspects of the site. However, I will eventually build out the front end using either Django's REST API or GraphQL (using something like http://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/) and some variation of React.js (either Next.js or Gatsby.js)
